* **Transparency** - The system maintains Transparency between the students and the college.

## Problem Statement
There are a lot of drawbacks in keeping and maintaining a hostel. Especially with a manualsystem. Since most hostels are being run by only one hostel manager, the number of studentsin a room are sometimes not known by the officer. He has to go room by room to ensure thata room is occupied or not. Sometimes people may be owing in the hostel and they are savedon papers or huge notebooks, and sometimes receipts. If the books should go missing orstolen, one would never be able to know if a student is owing or not. Room allocation alsobecomes a problem as the officer might not know which rooms are available or not. Andsome hostels have a lot of rooms or have mare storeys and it would be very tedious to gothrough all storeys in search of a free room for an applicant. Also the officer might not knowthe number of students in a room or know if a room is full or not.

## Functioning
* Displaying the status of the rooms
